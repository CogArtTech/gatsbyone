# What is edge computing?
Edge computing is a distributed information technology architecture in which client data is processed at the periphery of the network, as close to the originating source as possible. It pushes the frontier of computing applications, data and services away from centralized nodes.

# What is the difference between edge and cloud computing?

Edge computing refers to data processing power at the edge of a network instead of holding that processing power in a cloud or a central data warehouse. The name “edge” in edge computing is derived from network diagrams; typically, the edge in a network diagram signifies the point at which traffic enters or exits the network.

# What is the major advantage of the central cloud?

The major advantage of the central cloud architecture is rapid and low-cost deployment of (computing and/or storage-intensive) applications on generic servers shared amongst many applications with the aid of virtualization and orchestration technologies.

# What are the disadvantages of the central cloud?

The disdvantages of the central cloud are as follows:

1. The current hierarchical architecture makes central cloud resources and network connectivity the bottleneck for future growth. Sending data from hundreds of billions of client devices to tens of millions of centralized cloud servers wastes bandwidth and energy. Also, it has serious social and economic implications
2. Another disadvantage of central cloud architecture is the developer's reliance on cloud service providers that have access to the apps and the data stored or processed in their servers. As a result, today, a handful of very large companies have control over the vast majority of consumer and enterprise data.
3. Despite all the sophisticated security measures, storing data and hosting applications on third-party resources exposes the owners of the information to risks. Cloud resources have been designed for easy access to millions of developers and application service providers which in turn has increased vulnerabilities and security holes.

# What are the advantages of hybrid edgeCloud?

According to the fundamental priciples of Hybrid edgeCloud architcture, much of the computational processing is performed at the edge; communication is kept as local as possible.  Also, edge nodes collaborate and share computing and other resources.

The benefits of such an architecture are as follows:

1. reduced cloud hosting costs
2. reduced communication bandwidth and network efficiency
3. reduced energy consumption and carbon emission
4. reduced latency
5. reduce application development time
6. supports the increased trend for using microservices as the basic deployment unit for computation resouces
7. increases data privacy
8. gives consumers and enterprises better control over their data.
9. better scalability
10. minimizes transport costs and latencies for applications

# Is the Hybrid edgeCloud antithetical to using a cental cloud?
No

The “central cloud”, as defined as servers in data centers, remains a valuable resource in the modern enterprise. The central cloud may be indispensable for many applications that require central storage or processing.  Data center resources supporting a central cloud need to increase, but at a reasonable pace to accommodate the needs for central processing only. All the other possible tasks and functions should be delegated to edge nodes where today most of the data is generated.  When Hybrid edgeCloud is in force, servers in data centers will no longer be a bottleneck or the “always necessary” trust elements in an enterprise architecture. As a result, resources in the central cloud do not need to grow in proportion with edge nodes but only in proportion to the needs of central processing as dictated by the relevant use cases and associated applications.

# What is distributed edge computing architecture?
 A distributed edge computing architecture means that nodes (connected devices primarily) do not need the central cloud since they can process the data independently and communicate directly, sharing resources and collaborating in a dynamic hierarchy. Yet, in today’s cloud computing ecosystem all nodes are connected to the cloud; most nodes transmit raw data back to the cloud and communicate through the cloud in a fixed hierarchy that does not enable nodes to share resources and collaborate.

# What is the difference between edge and fog computing?
 Fog computing’s processing efforts are focused at the local area network end of the chain whereas edge computing pushes these efforts closer to the data source. Hence, each device on the network plays its own role in processing the information, instead of using a centralized server for the majority of processing.

# What are the main advantages of edge computing?

 The main advantages of edge computing are as follows: 

* Real-time or near real-time data analysis as the data is analyzed at the local device level, not in a distant data center or cloud.
* Lower operating costs due to the smaller operational and data management expenses of local devices versus clouds and data centers.
* Reduced network traffic because less data is transmitted from local devices via a network to a data center or cloud, thereby reducing network traffic bottlenecks.
* Improved application performance as apps that don’t tolerate latency can achieve lower latency levels on the edge, as opposed to a faraway cloud or data center.
