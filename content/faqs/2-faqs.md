# How is mimik technology similar to network mesh?

We do not do network mesh. Instead, our platform enables service mesh, which allows service-to-service communication.

# How does the technology differentiate from other IoT and other point-to-point networks?

This is the major differentiation. Other IoT technology requires a local gateway, to which IoT devices connect, and all communication among these device are proxyâ€™ed through by the gateway.

With our technology, every device can be turned into a server, and thus service-to-service communication happens without any gateway.
